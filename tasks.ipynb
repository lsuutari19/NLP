    "This code implements the personality detection presented in https://github.com/desaichirayu/Personality-Attribution-using-Natural-Language-Processing. Of the various models provided there, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) implementation was utilized since it seemed to provide the best overall performance among all traits. However, it required some modifications since it only provided a binary representation of the trait vector which would be poorly suited for PCA and would not allow determining the dominating traits.\n",

    "**UPDATE:** Some improvement regarding this after fixing the TF-IDF bug. In the first implementation, only one concatenated corpora was processed during one iteration, resulting in the IDF term being constant/zero(?!) Now, the concatenated corpora for all characters are inputted at the same time. Note that the same kind of preprocessing pipeline as for the training set is used (i.e. only lowercase transform). However, see report for possible limitations on using the TF-IDF model.\n",

    "However, according to literature, even the best personality trait detectors seem to top out at about 60 % in terms of accuracy (and this is, of course, even measured with similar data to the training data!) so not much can be expected. Perhaps better results could be obtained by utilizing a model specifically trained with dialogue but could not find many (there is MELD but I guess we are not allowed to use it; furthermore, it does not even use the Big Five traits...). Some alternatives for the second model:\n",
    "- TwitPersonality (https://github.com/D2KLab/twitpersonality): Could work better with dialogue (analogy to short tweets instead of the stream-of-consciousness essays used by some other models); however, a bit difficult to setup and utilizes the myPersonality dataset which is no longer officially available (of course, could still be obtained)\n",
